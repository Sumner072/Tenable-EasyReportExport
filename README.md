# Tenable-EasyReportExport
This is a Python 3 script I created as part of learning how to work with API tools involving some basic CRUD operations.  This script is currently designed around the use for an Analyst to just enter the name of the scan they want to have exports for and the script will then create a Scans folder, another sub-folder with the name of the scan itself, and then download the Executive Summary, By Asset, By Plugin, and CSV reports of the latest scan results into that folder.  Tenable API keys are required in a separate config.ini file in the same directory as the script.  This is mainly used as a project for getting more familiar with proper software development steps and my attempt to give back to the community.  Feel free to fork or use however you like or share any ideas.  This project is geared more towards learning than production, so updates will occur when I have time to get to them.
