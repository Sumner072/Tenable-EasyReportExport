# Tenable-EasyReportExport
This is a Python 3 script I created as part of learning how to work with API tools involving some basic CRUD operations.  This script is currently designed around the use for an Analyst to just enter the name of the scan they want to have exports for and the script will then create a Scans folder, another sub-folder with the name of the scan itself, and then download the Executive Summary, By Asset, By Plugin, and CSV reports of the latest scan results into that folder.  Tenable API keys are required in a separate config.ini file in the same directory as the script.
